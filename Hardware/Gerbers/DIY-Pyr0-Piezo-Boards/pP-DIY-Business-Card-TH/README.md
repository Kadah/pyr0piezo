# Pyr0-Piezo DIY BusinessCard

This variant of the Pyr0-Piezo circuit utilizes an all Through-Hole design, allowing users to easily solder in their own components.

This circuit also features a full breakout of all of the pins required to connect an external Arduino if the user doesn't want to use an integrated one.

Programming can be performed initially over the onboard ICSP header, and after a bootloader is installed, the user may reprogram the Atmega over the UART header. Alternatively, if the user owns an Arduino Uno with a DIL socket, the Atmega can be programmed using that board and transferred to this one afterward.

Pin assignments are shown on the silkscreen for each header
